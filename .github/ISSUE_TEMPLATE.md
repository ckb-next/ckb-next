# Before you proceed

- [ ] __Try__ the latest code by cloning and building the project manually.
- [ ] __Read__ the [`README.md`](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/blob/master/README.md) _in full_.
- [ ] __Skim__ through other `.md` documents in the project's root. They contain more specific information.
- [ ] __Search__ in open _and_ closed [Issues](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/issues). [Here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/).
- [ ] __Avoid__ opening a new issue in case a similar one already exists (don't worry, we get the notifications for closed issues as well, it will be reopened if needed).
- [ ] __Keep__ unrelated issues separate (create a new one if you are sure yours is unique).
- [ ] __Use__ [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to write on GitHub. Use triple backticks if copy-pasting more than _one_ line.

Now, __before you proceed even further__, make sure you are following the recommendations above. It will save a lot of time for you and us in the future.
