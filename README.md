<a target="_blank" href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23ckb-next&uio=d4"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/493242/14886493/5c660ea2-0d51-11e6-8249-502e6c71e9f2.png" height = "20" /></a>

**ckb-next** is an open-source driver for Corsair keyboards and mice. It aims to bring the features of Corsair's proprietary CUE software to the Linux and Mac operating systems. This project is currently a work in progress, but it already supports much of the same functionality, including full RGB animations. More features are coming soon. Testing and bug reports are appreciated!
