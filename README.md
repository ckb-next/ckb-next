**ckb-next** is an open-source driver for Corsair devices. It aims to bring the features of Corsair's proprietary iCUE software to Linux operating systems. This project is currently a work in progress, but it already supports much of the same functionality, including full RGB animations. More features are coming soon. Testing and bug reports are appreciated!
