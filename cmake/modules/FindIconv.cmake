#   - Try to find Iconv
#   
#   Once done this will define:
#       ICONV_FOUND - system has Iconv 
#       ICONV_INCLUDE_DIR - the Iconv include directory 
#       ICONV_LIBRARIES - Link these to use Iconv 
#       ICONV_SECOND_ARGUMENT_IS_CONST - the second argument for iconv() is
#       const
#   
#    As of 7/27/2012 the version of libiconv.2.dyld in /usr/lib is incompatible
#    with libintl.8.dylib in /opt/local/lib HINTS are used before looking in
#    the usual places...
