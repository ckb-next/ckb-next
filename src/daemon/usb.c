/// The main task of _usbsend () is to transfer the complete logical message from the buffer beginning with \a messages to <b>count * MSG_SIZE</b>.
/// \n According to usb 2.0 specification, a USB transmits a maximum of 64 byte user data packets.
/// For the transmission of longer messages we need a segmentation.
/// And that is exactly what happens here.
///
/// The message is given one by one to os_usbsend() in MSG_SIZE (= 64) byte large bites.
/// \attention This means that the buffer given as argument must be n * MSG_SIZE Byte long.
///
/// An essential constant parameter which is relevant for os_usbsend() only is is_recv = 0, which means sending.
///
/// Now it gets a little complicated again:
/// - If os_usbsend() returns 0, only zero bytes could be sent in one of the packets,
/// or it was an error (-1 from the systemcall), but not a timeout.
/// How many Bytes were sent in total from earlier calls does not seem to matter,
/// _usbsend() returns a total of 0.
/// - Returns os_usbsend() -1, first check if \b reset_stop is set globally
/// or (incomprehensible) hwload_mode is not set to "always".
/// In either case, _usbsend() returns 0,
/// otherwise it is assumed to be a temporary transfer error and it simply retransmits the physical packet after a long delay.
/// - If the return value of os_usbsend() was neither 0 nor -1,
/// it specifies the numer of bytes transferred.
/// \n Here is an information hiding conflict with os_usbsend() (at least in the Linux version):
/// \n If os_usbsend() can not transfer the entire packet,
/// errors are thrown and the number of bytes sent is returned.
/// _usbsend() interprets this as well
/// and remembers the total number of bytes transferred in the local variable \b total_sent.
/// Subsequently, however, transmission is continued with the next complete MSG_SIZE block
/// and not with the first of the possibly missing bytes.
/// \todo Check whether this is the same in the macOS variant. It is not dramatic, but if errors occur, it can certainly irritate the devices completely if they receive incomplete data streams. Do we have errors with the messages "Wrote YY bytes (expected 64)" in the system logs? If not, we do not need to look any further.
///
/// When the last packet is transferred,
/// _usbsend() returns the effectively counted set of bytes (from \b total_sent).
/// This at least gives the caller the opportunity to check whether something has been lost in the middle.
///

/// Handling the \b count MSG_SIZE blocks to be transferred is done
/// in the outer for (...) loop.

/// The usb protocol defines the cycles and periods in which actions are to be taken.
///
/// So in order to receive a data packet from the device,
/// the host must first send a send request.
/// \n This is done by _usbrecv() in the first block
/// by sending the MSG_SIZE large data block from \b out_msg via os_usbsend() as it is a machine depending implementation.
/// The usb target device is as always determined over kb.
///
/// For os_usbsend() to know that it is a receive request,
/// the \b is_recv parameter is set to true (1).
/// With this, os_usbsend () generates a control package for the hardware, not a data packet.
///
/// If sending of the control package is not successful,
/// a maximum of 5 times the transmission is repeated (including the first attempt).
/// If a non-cancelable error is signaled or the drive is stopped via reset_stop,
/// _usbrecv() immediately returns 0.
